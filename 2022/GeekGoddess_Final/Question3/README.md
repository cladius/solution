# The Ancestral Challenge (100 Marks)
Rahul and Ramesh are two cousins who live in the same house with their family. Earlier in their childhood, both shared quite a good bond between them. They used to go to the same school together, play video games together and sleep together. Rahul was more intelligent than Ramesh.

When they started to grow up, Ramesh started to get jealous of Rahul because Rahul was very good in academics and always got better marks than what Ramesh got. Slowly, Ramesh's family also started feeling jealous of Rahul’s family because Rahul’s father grew their family business quite better than Ramesh's father.

Due to this, other family members started praising Rahul’s father and started ignoring Ramesh’s family. So one day, out of frustration, Ramesh’s father told Rahul’s father that he wanted 70% of the total house space as he is elder than Rahul’s father. Rahul’s father agreed to his demand but on one condition.

### Condition
Rahul’s father will give Ramesh’s family a challenge to complete and if they complete the challenge, their demand will be fulfilled.

### Challenge
The challenge is to tell the Nth number which contains only odd digits in its number representation. Ramesh’s family tried their might but as they are not good at problem-solving, they are unable to complete the challenge. They are asking you for help. Can you solve this challenge for them?

For a better understanding, please see the sample test cases.
