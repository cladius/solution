# Solutions to Problems

## Goal
This repo serves the purpose of collating questions from the [**TechGig Code Gladiators**](https://www.techgig.com/codegladiators/top-ranker) contest. It also contains solutions for most of these problems. 
On many an occassion a particular problem beats us to a pulp. The fight is enjoyable. However, the lack of finding a solution at the end of the struggle 
leaves us wondering what we could have done differently to solve it. This repo is the online watering hole where the victors who have cracked the nut can 
share their successful strokes with the broader community. Let's grow together!

## Honor Code

Code sharing is to be done only **AFTER** TechGig has officially closed the round.

```
Win with honor OR
